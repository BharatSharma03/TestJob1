        conection...<br><br>

        the foremost professional skills training company in the world.<br><br>
        For the last 20 years Nick Smallman , has been showing people all over the world <br>
        how to develop their Charisma Gravitas and Presence . These are the essesntial <br>
        attribute of all highly successful people , and his executive coaching will give you<br>
        these skills.<br><br>
        <b>A different coaching method</b><br>
        A lot of executing coaching fails beacause the client is told what to do and to replace <br>
        thier current methods and technique. Unfortunately , human beings are creatures of<br>
        habit and insecurity. Usually, we all revert to old behaviour, so the new way get<br>
        lost.<br><br>
        <b>Reorganising the mind</b><br>
        Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and communicator by <br>
        using a series of  physchological techniques that once employed and embedded,<br>
        strengthrn your ability over time .Good coaching is about changing you mind on a <br>
        fundamental rather than showing you what to do.Real growth is <br>
        physchological. The physical will follow. He will teach you techniques not by telling<br>
        you what to do instead by giving your solutions that embed themselves in your<br>
        thinking. Over time, many things you thought were beyond possibility<br>
        become easy and natural.
