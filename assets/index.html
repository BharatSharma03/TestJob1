        <p>Are you in a buisness , politics, or a position of a responsibility ? Do you want to<br>
        influence  those  around  you  in  a  way  that  improves  your  reputation  ? <br>
        <br>Do you want to be understood and remembered  ? would you like to be highly
        <br>respected and for a people to act on what you've said after meeting you in person.<br>
        Would you like to be able to tell a compelling story or give a speech that has your <br>
        audience hooked ? Maybe your needs are a little more human and lower key ...<br>
        maybe you'd like more confidence , to be more aproachable and likeable and to<br> influence other people in a way that generate warmth , admiration and <br>
        conection...<br><br>
        If so , this is your opportunity to be personally coached by the FOUNDER & CEO of <br>
        the foremost professional skills training company in the world.<br><br>
        For the last 20 years Nick Smallman , has been showing people all over the world <br>
        how to develop their Charisma Gravitas and Presence . These are the essesntial <br>
        attribute of all highly successful people , and his executive coaching will give you<br>
        these skills.<br><br>
        <b>A different coaching method</b><br>
        A lot of executing coaching fails beacause the client is told what to do and to replace <br>
        thier current methods and technique. Unfortunately , human beings are creatures of<br>
        habit and insecurity. Usually, we all revert to old behaviour, so the new way get<br>
        lost.<br><br>
        <b>Reorganising the mind</b><br>
        Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and communicator by <br>
        using a series of  physchological techniques that once employed and embedded,<br>
        strengthrn your ability over time .Good coaching is about changing you mind on a <br>
        fundamental rather than showing you what to do.Real growth is <br>
        physchological. The physical will follow. He will teach you techniques not by telling<br>
        you what to do instead by giving your solutions that embed themselves in your<br>
        thinking. Over time, many things you thought were beyond possibility<br>
        become easy and natural.
